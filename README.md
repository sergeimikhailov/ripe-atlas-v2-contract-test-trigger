# RIPE Atlas API Contract Test Trigger

[ ![Codeship Status for sergeimikhailov/ripe-atlas-v2-contract-test-trigger](https://app.codeship.com/projects/b4d78040-f882-0134-33ee-76e4f316aab3/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/210990)

This project contains AWS Lambda function that will trigger latest build in Codeship for given Codeship project.

Written to trigger [ripe-atlas-v2-contract-test](//github.com/sergeimikhailov/ripe-atlas-v2-contract-test) build on schedule.
That repo contains contract test for RIPE NCC Atlas Probe API v2 which should run regularly. And free Codeship account does not provide scheduling facility ;-) 

To build and test:
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

To deploy:
```bash
